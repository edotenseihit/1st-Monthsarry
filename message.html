  <h1>To My Babyyyy ❤️</h1>
  <p>
    Hello babyyyy, Happy 1st Monthsarry for us, I’m very blessed to have u, and i create this to show you how i’m in love to you, this is worth the risk ever, I’m a lucky guy to have you because you’re so caring, loving, conservative, beautiful, and also being a cute girl. I still remember the day i first see you, we’re strangers, but it’s like we had a string that met our paths over and over again, Red String Theory, i really love how we crossed paths again, and day by day, i keep falling to you. I still remember the day i first chat again in November 14, i took the risk to talk to you again, and i thought it end up real quick but there’s residuals on me, but the plot twist in December 5, 8:48PM, playing valorant that time, i was flabbergasted when you first move to me and took a risk on it, I didn’t think twice to chat you back because i really like you like i do this time, and i’m very happy that we keep this relationship to another level. In the day we first meet, i can really see how happy you are when you saw me, and i keep smiling all day because i finally see my love of my life, the risk of it is really worth it, and we spend the 2weeks being together, being happy, there’s a fight we faced but that’s not the reason to leave each other, i rather fix it with you for a thousand times, rather than to leave you again like i did in the past. In the day i finally going here in Bulacan, i keep crying in the night of December 28 because i will sacrifice my hometown to go to school and leave my baby around in my hometown, so i spend my time with you and i enjoy it until you arrive at the terminal, and regretted the decision to go to Bulacan in early. I really love the times we spend together and hoping, manifesting, and praying to God to marry you in the future, i pray to God every time, and i miss you my baby, i really miss you, i will sacrifice all to have and get you forever, i don’t want to leave you and lost you again. I love you my baby, Happy 1st Monthsarry, I’m sorry i’m not in your side but my loyalty and love will be yours forever, i love you my baby
